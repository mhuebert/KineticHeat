Matt.is CV.

Two years ago I designed a single-page static CV integrating a timeline and world map: http://www.scribd.com/doc/9683205/Resume-with-horizontal-timeline-and-world-map

Upon discovering the Isotope jQuery plugin (http://isotope.metafizzy.co/) I decided to revisit the CV, this time with an interactive approachâ€”leading to a less dense but more flexible presentation of information.

This is an early release, and is inferior to my static CV in a number of respects:
* Lacks a timeline - duration and order of activities is not visually apparent
* Lacks a world map - geographic dimension of work is ignored
* Lacks detail for each activity

However, new advantages are introduced:
* Activities can be ranked by passion, time invested, or recency, or filtered by type.
* While information density is reduced, individual views are clearer. Activities are compared one dimension at a time. 
* Animated transitions give the user an intuitive grasp of an activity's ranking across two dimensions. For example, if you switch from "Time Invested" to "Passion", activities which animate downward indicate a mismatch between what I'm passionate about vs. what I spend my time on.
* It's now easy for me to embed links to external resources.
