        <p>
          Traditional electric heat wraps, which use high voltage electricity and wire coil heating elements, can be hazardous.
        </p>
        <p>Extra-low-voltage +Venture heat wraps are recommended by doctors. They are a safe alternative to traditional electric pads, and more economical than single-use throw-away pads.</p>
        <h3>Why +Venture Heat Wraps?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong class='hilite'>Hours of Continuous Heat</strong>
        </p>
        <p>+Venture heat wraps are designed to provide up to 7 hours of continuous, even, low-temperature heat on a single charge.</p>
        <p>
          <strong class='hilite'>Safe</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to poor design and high voltages, electric heating pads of the past were hazardous and could cause fires and burns. +Venture heat wraps are safer than old designs because they use an
          <strong>extra-low-voltage</strong>
          design (7-8 volts).
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong class='hilite'>Reliable, Even Heat</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          +Venture heat wraps use
          large surface area, flexible, carbon fibre heating layers
          which provide
          <strong>even heat, with no hot-spots,</strong>
          unlike traditional electric coil heating elements.

      <div class='vtabs-content-item' id='how-c'>
        <h3>How do heat wraps relieve pain?</h3>
        <p>
          <strong class='hilite'>1. Pain Signals are Blocked</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Heat activates special thermo-sensitive nerves. When these nerves send signals to the brain, they block other signals (like pain) that are trying to reach the brain at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>So, heat sensations effectively offset pain sensations.</p>
        <p>
          <strong class='hilite'>2. Muscle Tissue is Relaxed</strong>
        </p>
        <p>Pain causes a reflex-reaction, so that muscles around an injury tense up. This tension can exacerbate the pain and even lead to painful muscle spasms that can make an injury worse.</p>
        <p>Heat relaxes muscle tissue, avoiding spasms and increasing comfort.</p>
        <p>
          <strong class='hilite'>3. Blood Flow is Increased</strong>
        </p>
        <p>As pain causes muscle tissue to tense up, blood flow is decreased and this makes healing more difficult and slow.</p>
        <p>Deep, penetrating heat increases blood flow to the affected area, helping to flush our toxins and bring in more oxygen, leading to faster healing.</p>

      <div class='vtabs-content-item' id='usage-c'>
        <h3>Aim for long-duration, low-temperature heat</h3>
        <p>The latest research shows that heat is most effective when applied continuously, for hours at a time, at a low temperature (about 40°C or 104°F). Long-duration (up to 8 hours at a time) application of heat has been proven more effective than the short treatments which have been prescribed in the past.</p>
