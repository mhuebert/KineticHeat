So I'm sitting at "Startup Drinks":http://www.startupdrinks.ca/ in Vancouver last night when "Delano Mandelbaum":http://goldensword.ca/, the singular human force behind website monitoring tool "BlameStella":https://www.blamestella.com, lends me a productivity tip which I think might just change the world, if only it can be paired with a great user interface.

The trick is simple: whenever you find yourself consciously wasting your time (__time__, you recall? that precious gift of life that "brilliant modern moguls (Mark Pincus)":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Pincus make it their explicit goal to absorb, sponge-like...), *switch your computer screen to grayscale*. On a mac, you can either adjust these settings "manually":http://osxdaily.com/2010/05/04/make-your-mac-run-in-grayscale-mode/ or use "this applescript":/post-images/GrayscaleToggle.zip.

Life in grayscale is weird... disorienting, strange, foreign. You can't help but realize something in your life isn't.. quite.. right. It doesn't take long for the subtle discomfort to nudge me back into the real-world or back to work.

Most of us can't avoid social media, hell--we rely on it. The evil is not connectedness itself, it's the trance-like suckage that turns two minute Facebook message replies into forty minute photo browsing escapades. With tens of thousands of engineers devoting their lives to various "forms":http://www.twitter.com of "computerized crack":http://www.facebook.com, the "focus" problem is only going to get worse.

We need a reminder: life online is life in monochrome.

But we have a problem: this approach is awkward without a good tool. I'd like a simple app that lets me list the websites I hate but can't live without (perhaps the app could be called "Nemesis"?), and then forces my screen into grayscale whenever I visit them. Bonus points if it can turn my screen into an evil-looking blood-red monochrome for the worst offenders...
