__"Each dollar spent on cigarettes adds fuel to the sophisticated marketing of tobacco to youth."__

Does it matter that smokers, through no explicit desire of their own, fund the marketing of tobacco to non-smokers?

We shrug off tobacco profits as a necessary evil, and pass off most health impacts as self-inflicted. But how can we justify the use of sophisticated marketing techniques to cause more people to smoke? How can we deny that money spent on marketing tobacco actually causes people to smoke who otherwise wouldnâ€™t, and that by purchasing cigarettes, smokers are financially complicit in this circle?

What if smokers could buy cigarettes without funding tobacco marketing?

Smokers have a kind of leverage that non-smokers do not: the power to choose where (not) to spend their money. An independent, non-profit tobacco organization could sell cigarettes of equal quality to popular brands, benefit from cheap access to media and the good will of society, and devote all profits to fund cancer research and anti-smoking campaigns.
