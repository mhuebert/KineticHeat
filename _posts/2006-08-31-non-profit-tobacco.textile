__"Each dollar spent on cigarettes adds fuel to the sophisticated marketing of tobacco to youth."__

Does it matter that smokers, against their own wishes, fund the marketing of tobacco to non-smokers?

We shrug off tobacco profits as a necessary evil, and pass off most health impacts as self-inflicted. But how can we justify investing in sophisticated marketing techniques that cause more people to smoke?

What if smokers could buy cigarettes without funding tobacco marketing?

Smokers have a kind of leverage that non-smokers do not: the power to choose where (not) to spend their money. An independent, non-profit tobacco organization could sell cigarettes of equal quality to popular brands, benefit from cheap access to media and the good will of society, and devote all profits to fund cancer research and anti-smoking campaigns.
